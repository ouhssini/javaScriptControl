# Products Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple web-based products management system using jQuery. It allows users to view products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage the cart items.

## Features

- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items from the cart.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The cart updates dynamically as items are added or removed, and displays the total price.
- **Stock and Category Insights**: The system can also display products below stock threshold and filter products by categories like 'PC'.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (jQuery)
- JSON (for data storage)
